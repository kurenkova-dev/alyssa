This is a blog made during my studies of the Django Framework. 
I learnt how to build a project due to the brilliant book "Django 3 by Example" written by Antonio Mele. 
This was an extremely inspiring reading, so I after studying each chapter I would build a similar project by myself. 

Here is the first project, a blog of "The End of the F-cking World" character, Alyssa.
